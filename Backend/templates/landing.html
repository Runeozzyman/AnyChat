            It features a chat rooms where users can join with a nickname of their choice, and engage in conversation with whoever they're matched with.

            <br><br>
            AnyChat was created not only as a fun project to further develop my web development skills, 
            but also to help foster spontatneous connections between strangers; Something that has seemingly become increasingly rare.
