# AnyChat

AnyChat is a web-based chat application made to spontaneously connect strangers worldwide in a time-limited chat instance. I started developing AnyChat as a means to further my web-development skills and learn new technologies, but also to help create organic connections amongst people that seem to have become increasingly rare today.

## Tech Stack

The first iteration(s) of AnyChat were built using a Flask backend running SocketIO to handle data and message passing, and a simple JavaScript frontend with clean minimal designs for a straight-forward user experience.

Given that I have prior experience with Flask, I decided to overhaul my backend system with Node.JS for a few reasons:

**1)** Node.JS is ideal for real-time applications given its non-blocking, event-driven nature

**2)** The architecture of Node.JS also supports multiple concurrent connections, leading to greater efficiency and scalability

**3)** I haven't used Node.JS before!

## Updates

As of now, AnyChat is still under development and is yet to be hosted, but as soon as I am able to I will update this readme with a live link so you can try AnyChat for yourself :)
